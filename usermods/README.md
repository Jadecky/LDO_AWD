# Mods by users - For users
This section houses creations from users that have either made assembly easier, improved functionality or just look too-darn-cool!

## Requirements
* All mods must abide by GPLv3 licensing standards. This means the CAD document (preferably .STEP format) must be included along with printable STL files. Additionally, attribution must be provided if an external source file was used (all mods here are assumed to derrive from the kits, no attribution to these kits are necessary).
* All STL files are expected to be print ready, meaning their orientation should not need to change after importing into the users' preferred slicer.
* Include some images of the finished product. This can either be a render or a photo of a printed part
* Include a BOM (bill of materials) and note whether or not the required hardware was already included in the kit.
* If the mod changes, removes, or improves functionality, please describe how it does so
* If the mod is a complex change you'll need to include documentation in some form on how to install your mod.
* Kit compatability should use the following: `:heavy_check_mark:` for compatible,`:x:` for NOT compatible and `:grey_question:` for unknown compatability
